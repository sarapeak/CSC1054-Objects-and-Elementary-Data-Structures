(5 points) What happens to an application if it has a runtime exception? Does it still work or does it cease functioning? Try it out.
When there is a runtime exception, the program continues to run but it will show the error in the error messages and nothing will happen to the program itself.

(5 points) What happens if... (Try both a. and b. out and report the findings.)
   (a) you modify the active scene at runtime (does it update the GUI automatically?)
   When you modify the scene during runtime, it automatically updates the GUI.
   
   (b) you add a new component (like a button) at runtime to the active scene (does it update the GUI work automatically?)
   When you add a new component at runtime, it does not update. The program needs to be closed, re-compiled, and then run again.

(5 points) List 2 differences between interfaces and abstract classes.
Since interfaces are a collection of abstract methods which are then implemented using the implement class, the methods in the interface don't need to be used when other classes are inheriting it. Instead of giving an ability to a full object like absrtact classes, interfaces give ability to something. 

(5 points) How are interfaces used in this lab?
In this lab, we use the EventHandler interface so it will allow us to program the event we want to happen.
