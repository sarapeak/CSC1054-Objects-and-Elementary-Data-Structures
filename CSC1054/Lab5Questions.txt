1. (5 points)  What does a GridPane do? What does a BorderPane do?
A GridPane lays out each compnent in a grid. The coder can indicate the where a component is to go and the components do not have to be of equal size. A BorderPane creates 5 different areas in which the coder can add things to. The areas can resize depending on the size of the pane and components. 

2. (5 points) What happens if you don’t extend a Pane (for example FlowPane) and try to add it to the “root”? Why does this happen?
I recieve an error that states that they are incompatible types. By not extending the pane, the thing that is trying to be added to the root is not a javafx object which means it cannot be added to root.
