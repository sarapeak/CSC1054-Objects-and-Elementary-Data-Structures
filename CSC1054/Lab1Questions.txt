1. (4 points) Why would you want to use an array list over an array when you have to add and remove things from the middle of the list?
An ArrayList allows you to have a list without parameters allowing the user or coder to input as many indexes as they desire until they end it themselves. An ArrayList gives more freedom over an array.

2. (4 points) List three ArrayList methods, which were not listed in the book. To do this, look up the array list class online.
ensureCapacity(int minCapacity)
listIterator()
retainAll(Collection<?> c)

3. (2 point) Why would a do-while loop be preferable to a while loop in Part III of this lab?
A do while loop would be preferable because it will loop though the code one time even if what the user inputted is wrong. A do while loop will test the condition entered at the end of it. A while loop would test the condition in the beginning. 

4. (5 points) Consider part I of this lab, what would the problem have been with having temperature public (instead of private) and setting the value of temperature in main?
It is a good rule of thumb to have all member variables set to private. This ensures that these member variables can only be changed in the class when using a mutator. Having it set to public would not allow the member variable to be contained in the class.

5. (2.5 points) We don’t want to reinvent the wheel (have the same code twice). What does that mean for Part I, given that the constructor that takes in a temperature and the mutator, setTempInF, also takes in a temperature?
This means that you don't want to copy the same code you used. If you already have the code, it is a waste of space to make it again in a different section. It would be more simplistic to return the method that has the mutator for any method that takes in a temperature.

6. (2.5 points) Why does, after Set (2) = (1).i.e., gauge2 = gauge1;, the print out (1) change when you changed (2) and not (1)?
Because (2) is now looking at the (1) object and identifies that its memory is in (1), therefore, the change needs to be made in (1) instead of (2).
