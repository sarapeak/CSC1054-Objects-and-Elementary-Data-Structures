1. (5 points)  Why not use == to compare objects?
== compares object references, not the object themselves.

2. (5 points) How do you make .equals work to compare objects?
You make a .equals work by creating an instance of the object of the variable to compare each parameter in the object.

3. (5 points) why does it not make sense for a static method to be able to use an instance class variable?
Static methods are associated with the class and not with any object. Static methods can be used called even when objects have not been instantiated.

4. (5 points) how is a static variable different from a non-static variable?
A static variable is shared among all instances of a class while non-static variables are specific to that instance of a class
